# Donation-of-Constantine-3D-Unity-Videogame
3D video game developed under the unity engine. This game aims to teach the player of an important European historical event known as the Donation of Constantine. This was my very first experience with Unity moreover any form of game development.
For some reason, github desktop decided to be a bit buggy and put the entirety of the game in the Assets folder. From there, you will be able to find whatever you might want.
